//0. DESCRIBE IN YOUR OWN WORDS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LET AND CONST


//1. Write a for loop that logs only logs even numbers from 0 - 10; ie 0,2,4,..10
     

//2. Write a for that logs numbers from 10 - 0; ie 10,9,8...0


//3. write a for loop that loops through this array and logs 'odd/even' based on wether the number is odd even
let nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

//4. write a while loop that starts at 0 and counts up to 10 ie: 0,1,2,3....10


//5. Look closely at the code below
const isOdd = (num) =>{
    return num % 2 === 0
}

if(isOdd(2)){
    console.log('is Odd')
} else {
    console.log('is Even')
}

//5a. what will this log?


//5b. what is the value of isOdd(2) 


//5c. Fix the isOdd function to make this work

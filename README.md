 go through these brainteaser

## instructions
1. cd into folder where you want this project to live (probably week1)
2. git clone git@github.com:jimibue/js-basics-hw.git
3. cd js-basics-hw
4. do challenges in homework.js

## Challenges

### Loops
1. Write a for loop that logs only logs even numbers from 0 - 10; ie 0,2,4,..10
2. Write a for that logs numbers from 10 - 0; ie 10,9,8...0
3. write a for loop that loops through this array and logs 'odd/even' based on wether the number is odd even

```javascript
let nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```
4. write a while loop that starts at 0 and counts up to 10 ie: 0,1,2,3....10
5. Look closely at the code below

```javascript
const isOdd = (num) =>{
    return num % 2 === 0
}

if(isOdd(2)){
    console.log('is Odd')
} else {
    console.log('is Even')
}
```
6. what will this log?
7. what is the value of isOdd(2) 
8. Fix the isOdd function to make this work

### Functions
1. Write a function that takes a positive number and prints all even numbers from 0 – number
2. Write a function that takes an array and returns the sum of all the numbers
3. Write a function that returns the number of vowels in string
4. Write a function that takes a math operator, as a string, ('*','/','+','-') and two numbers and returns the result
5. Write a function that takes an array of strings and a string and returns true or false if the string is in the array.
6. write a function that takes a person object {firstname: 'joe', lastname: 'shmoe', age: 50} and returns a formatted string "joe shmoe is 50 years old"
7. write a function that takes an array that removes the first and last items and return that new array
8. write a function that swaps the last and first items of an array 
9. write a function that takes a array and a second argument and returns the index in the array of the second argument
10. write a function that takes a number and uses a ternary to return if the number is odd or even.
